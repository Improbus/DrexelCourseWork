To compile and run the program, just run:
ant

To start a game, you will have to start two instances of the program: a server and a client

The server is always 'White', the client is always 'Black'

You must specify a player name of at least 2 characters.
The server (Host a Match) runs on localhost, 
The client (Join a Match) can also run on localhost (to run both on the same machine)
or you can enter the address of the server in the client's login window to start a game.

The game starts with it being White's turn.
Alternatively, you can choose to load a game by selecting File -> Load and specifying a valid .pgn file
