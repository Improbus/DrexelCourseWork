Assignment 3

The Java Calculator assignment was difficult for me having little previous
experience in Java so I consulted a few sources to help with the algorithms.
The sources were as follows:

http://scriptasylum.com/tutorials/infix_postfix/algorithms/infix-postfix/index.htm
http://scriptasylum.com/tutorials/infix_postfix/algorithms/postfix-evaluation/index.htm
http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Collections-Data-Structure/Convertsinfixarithmeticexpressionstopostfix.htm

I tried my best using these sources and my knowledge from class to finish
the assignment.  I am aware that the program does not parse entirely
correctly but I believe I am close.  I also appologize for the lateness of
the assignment, I had some computer trouble last night and was unable to
submit it on time.
