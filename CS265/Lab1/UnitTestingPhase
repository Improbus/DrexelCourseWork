
Unit Testing Phase
------------------

(sung to the tune of Margaritaville)

My machine's a bit shaky;
Her monitor's flaky.
She's been on a long time and just needs a rest.
So I kiss and I hug her,
And I start the debugger,
And I say "Baby it's just one more test."

The source code is unclear.
There's no real design here.
The statements are choppy, and the logic's no good.
I hope for the best tho,
But even I know,
That the problem domain was not well understood.

Wasting my time again in unit testing phase.
Searching for the source of this abnormal halt.
Some people claim that there is Microsoft to blame,
But I know, it's nobody's fault.

Code duplication,
No initialization,
Pointers to objects that no longer exist.
And this binary tree here,
Is staring at me queer,
Wondering why he's not a linked list.

Wasting my time again in unit testing phase.
Searching for the source of this abnormal halt.
Some people claim that there is Microsoft to blame,
But I know, it's the architect's fault.

But there's no going back now.
I'll kludge it somehow.
The waterfall model is what's practiced here.
And so the design's done;
And if it can't run,
It's an implementation problem, I fear.

Wasting my time again in unit testing phase.
Searching for the source of this abnormal halt.
Some people claim that there is Microsoft to blame,
But I know, it's my own damn fault.
