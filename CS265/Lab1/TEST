     execute any external shell command.

  3. As an example type   ls   following the ! and then hit <ENTER>.  This
     will show you a listing of your directory, just as if you were at the
     shell prompt.

Note:  It is possible to execute any external command this way.

Note:  All  :  commands must be finished by hitting <ENTER>

     ** To save the changes made to the file, type  :w FILENAME. **

  1. Type  :!ls  to get a listing of your directory.
     You already know you must hit <ENTER> after this.

  2. Choose a filename that does not exist yet, such as TEST.

  3. Now type:	 :w TEST   (where TEST is the filename you chose.)

  4. This saves the whole file	(Vim Tutor)  under the name TEST.
     To verify this, type    :!dir   again to see your directory

Note: If you were to exit Vim and enter again with the filename TEST, the file
      would be an exact copy of the tutor when you saved it.

  5. Now remove the file by typing:  	:!rm TEST

	** To save part of the file, type   :#,# w FILENAME **

  1. Once again, type  :!dir  or  :!ls  to obtain a listing of your directory
     and choose a suitable filename such as TEST.

  2. Move the cursor to the top of this page (screen) and type  Ctrl-g  to
     find the number of that line.  REMEMBER THIS NUMBER!

  3. Now move to the bottom of the page and type  Ctrl-g again.  REMEMBER THIS
     LINE NUMBER ALSO!

  4. To save ONLY a section to a file, type   :#,# w TEST   where #,# are
     the two numbers you remembered (top,bottom) and TEST is your filename.

  5. Again, see that the file is there with  :!ls  but DO NOT remove it.
