Q1:
	When bug3 ran an error was produced and stated Segmentation fault (core
	dumped).  It also created an executable file named bug3.

Q2:
	The function that the program bombed on was as follows:
		#0  0x00002abe8a7a6090 in strcmp ()

Q3:

	a. For bug1.c one the second arugument of scanf needs to be passed by
		 reference.

	b. For bug2.c the formatting for the output stream was incorrect switching
		 the float and decimal.

	c. For bug3.c one of the while loops was itterating before the values were
		 being added to the array. 

	d. For avg.c the scanf function's second argument is not passed by
		 reference. 

	e. In quicksortBug.c there are a pair of braces missing to separate the
		 for loop and also last is iterated in the wrong direction. 

Q4: 
	The compiler cannot catch this because the syntax isn't incorrect its just
	the logic is incorrect therefore producing an infinite for loop which is not
	a recognizable error by the compiler.  One can see this in the stack because
	the same value appears in the stack over and over again.

Q5:
	An error will be produced because the string comparison function cannont
	differentiate the difference in integer values.
