Assignment 2

This program takes a webpage and parses the information into 2 dictionaries.
From these two dictionaries one is able to search for flights via Flight
Company or by flight number.  There are 2 menu functions that control the
user interface and an option is present to quit the program. Though not very
visually appealing the program fulfills its purpose.
