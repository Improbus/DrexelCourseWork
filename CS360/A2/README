Grammars:

I used the following grammar for both parsers.

command -> closure
closure -> term
term -> concat
concat -> union
union -> letter

Which is very similar to this example given in class

%{
/*  yacc parser to recognize the regular language (a|b)*abb  */
#include <string.h>
%}

%%


S0: 'a' S1    { printf("S0 -> aS1\n"); } 
  | 'b' S0    { printf("S0 -> bS0\n"); } 
  ;

S1: 'a' S1    { printf("S1 -> aS1\n"); } 
  | 'b' S2    { printf("S1 -> bS2\n"); } 
  ;

S2: 'a' S1    { printf("S2 -> aS1\n"); } 
  | 'b' S3    { printf("S2 -> bS3\n"); }
  ;

S3: 'a' S1    { printf("S3 -> aS1\n"); }
  | 'b' S0    { printf("S3 -> bS0\n"); }
  |           { printf("S3 -> epsilon\n"); }
  ;
%%
 but instead of yacc PLY was used.

As goes for the two programs.  I believe I followed all instructions and
they are working correctly to my knowledge.  I have included a test file for
each.  I have adheared to good style and the instructions and if there is
any problem with the assignment please let me know.  

The only problem I had I could not get the byHand parser to read multiple
lines of input.
