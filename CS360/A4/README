prop-calc.scm

THis function seems to be working fine by itself, I think there may be some bugs in the 
driver loop but alone the eval function reports the correct answer always.

1 ]=> (load "prop-calc.scm")

;Loading "prop-calc.scm" -- done
;Value: metacircular-evaluator-loaded

1 ]=> (define the-global-environment (setup-environment))

;Value: the-global-environment

The taut-test function must be run with the following syntax.

(taut-test exp (gen-table (count-var exp)))

Example:

(taut-test '(or P (not P)) (gen-table (count-var '(or P (not P)))))

Other than this the tau-test is working to my knowledge.  For some reason i couldn't consolidate
the environment creation into a function so it needs to be called like shown above.
