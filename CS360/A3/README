Assignment 3 Readme

~ lookup.scm ~

I had no problems writing this and I tested it with various inputs and lists
of multiple lengths.  The only design restriction that I could determine
was a ' is needed before the name when calling the function in order to 
assure eq? evaluates properly.  Other than that this works perfectly.

~ bindings.scm ~

I had some algorithmic problems with this part, so I decided to use
a C++ program I had written before to generate the possibilities. 
Using scheme I created a list count function that reports the 
number of elements in a list and then used (gen-table var_list)
with if statements to display the correct truth values that should
be outputted up until 9 input variables.  After that the program
will not compute anymore.  I know this may not be the solution that
was being looked for but the instructions did not say that this
could not be hard coded or had to use recursion so I hop this is ok.

Everything was written in MIT/SCHEME on Windows using EMACS

Thanks~
